Here I learned how to build node cli.

- In nodepath I read a directory and compress each image inside it using sharp.
- In nodearguments I use cheerio for searching a css selector in a url provided by the user. Then I also used commander to help me build the cli.
- In nodequotes I fetch a quotes url in cheerio and return the quote.
